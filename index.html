		<div>Derby air conditioners come with a 5 year warranty.

All the new Derby units are fully compliant with the latest MEPS standards as set out in the relevant Australian and New Zealand standards, and Derby remains committed to the most energy efficient units available. Standby power has been reduced to only 20% of previous models by the use of Intelligent On/Off technology.

Derby air conditioners have a specialized biological enzyme andEco filter that catches very small airborne dust particles and aids in neutralising bacteria, fungi and microbes. Biological enzyme acts on bacteria by dissolving their cell wall thus reducing the problem of re-pollution seen in air conditioners without such filtration.

		<div>Daikin air conditioners come with a 5 year warranty.

Daikin Ducted Air Conditioners consist of an indoor and outdoor unit and flexible ducting. The indoor unit is concealed out of sight, in your ceiling or under the floor, with flexible ducting distributing conditioned air through vents located throughout your home. An outdoor unit is positioned in a discreet location outside your home.

Daikin Exceeds MEPS Energy Efficiency Requirements:
In the interests of increasing the overall air conditioner efficiency, all ducted air conditioners with a cooling capacity of up to 65kW sold in Australia must now comply with the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), as set out in Australian Standard 3823.2:2013. All Daikin air conditioners exceed MEPS requirements, in line with Daikin’s commitment to providing energy efficient, quiet, simple to use and reliable air conditioning solutions.
